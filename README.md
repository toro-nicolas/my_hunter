### Goal
In this project, you are asked to make a **small video game** based on the rules of **Duck Hunt**.    
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:    
• the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.    
• ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.    
• the player can click on them to shoot them.    

In my version of the game, the story takes place in the world of **Terraria**.    
You're no longer a hunter, but a **player** being attacked at night by **demon eyes**.    
_Will you manage to kill them all ?_

### How to compile it ?
Make the game :
```shell
make
```

Re make the game :
```shell
# This command will deleted all the compiled files
make re
```

Remove all compiled files (*.o) :
```shell
make clean
```

Remove all compiled files (*.o) and the libmy.a file :
```shell
make fclean
```

Make the game and launch it :
```shell
# This command will "make re" the game
make run
```

Make a unit_tests file :
```shell
make unit_tests
```

Make and run a unit_tests file with the coverage :
```shell
make tests_run
```

Make the game and valgrind it :
```shell
make valgrind
```

### How to play ?
Launch the game :    
```Shell
./my_hunter
```

Launch the game with the eric mode (infinite lives and arrows) :
```Shell
./my_hunter -e 
./my_hunter --eric
```

Play :    
- Click on play    
- Demons eyes will appear and you'll have to kill them    
- To kill them, move your cursor over them and click on a mouse button or press the enter key of your keyboard    
- After that, the mob will lose 1 life point    
- If a mob have 0 life point, he die    
- If you don't click on a monster, you lose 1 arrow    
- If a monster disappear of the window, you lose 1 life    
- Each small monster killed give you 100 points and each big monster give you 300 points score    
- At each 1000 points score, you level up    
- Each mobs kill will respawn    
- Each mobs respawned, have a velocity depending on the level    
- An untouched monster is not dead, but it reappears somewhere else with the same characteristics    
- From level 5, big monsters can appear    

Pause :    
- When you are in game, you can press Escape for access to pause menu    
- In this menu, the time is stopped and monsters don't move    
- You can resume the game by pressing the escape key or the continue button    

Settings :    
- You can go to the settings for change parameters    
- If you want to change the size, you just have to click on the size and restart the game    
- You can enable infinite lives and infinite arrow which are activated by default only for eric mode    
- You can also change the game volume    
- All settings are saved and loaded when the game is launched
